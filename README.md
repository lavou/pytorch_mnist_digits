MNIST Image Classifier with PyTorch

Short code for training an image classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset, using PyTorch. The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images representing hand-drawn digits from 0 to 9. The trained model can accurately classify these digits. This repo includes data loading, model definition, training loop, and saving/loading of the model's state.
